## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Speed Calculation**
```python
# Download speed calculation
download_speed_mbps = file_size_mb / download_time

# Upload speed calculation  
upload_speed_mbps = file_size_mb / upload_time

# Running average calculation
new_average = (old_average * (count - 1) + new_speed) / count
```

### **Enhanced Logging**
